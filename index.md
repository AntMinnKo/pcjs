Welcome to [PCjs](/docs/about/pcjs/), the first IBM PC simulation to run in your web browser without any plugins.
It was added to the [JavaScript Machines](/docs/about/) project in Fall 2012, and it is now part of the
[PCjs Project](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs) on GitHub.

The project includes the following web-based emulators:

* [PCjs](/docs/pcjs/), an IBM PC and PC-compatible emulator 
* [PC8080](/modules/pc8080/), an 8080-based machine emulator
* [C1Pjs](/docs/c1pjs/), a simulation of the 6502-based OSI Challenger 1P

PCjs first simulated the 4.77Mhz 8088-based IBM PC, and has steadily evolved to support more classic x86 machines,
including the IBM PC XT, the 80286-based IBM PC AT, and the 80386-based COMPAQ DeskPro 386.  PCjs fully supports
the original machine ROMs, video cards, etc, and all machines run at their original speeds.

All the simulations are written entirely in [JavaScript](/modules/).  No Flash, Java or other plugins are required.
Supported browsers include modern versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer (v9.0 and up), Edge,
and assorted mobile browsers.

The [simulation](/devices/pc/machine/5150/mda/64kb/) above features an Intel 8088 running at 4.77Mhz,
with 64Kb of RAM and an IBM Monochrome Display Adapter.  For more control, there are also
[Control Panel](/devices/pc/machine/5150/mda/64kb/debugger/) and [Soft Keyboard](/devices/pc/machine/5150/mda/64kb/softkbd/)
configurations, featuring the built-in PCjs Debugger.  For even greater control, build your own PC. The
[PCjs Documentation](/docs/pcjs/) will help you get started.

The goals of the [JavaScript Machines](/docs/about/) project are to create fast, full-featured simulations of classic
computer hardware, help people understand how these early machines worked, make it easy to experiment with different
machine configurations, and provide a platform for running and analyzing old computer software.

Some pre-configured machines are shown below, ready to run BASIC, DOS, Windows, OS/2, and other assorted software.

There are many more [PCjs Demos](/devices/pc/machine/#ready-to-run-app-demos), including an
[IBM PC with Dual Displays](/devices/pc/machine/5150/dual/64kb/) demonstrating early multi-monitor support,
and multiple IBM PC XT machines running side-by-side with [CGA Displays](/devices/pc/machine/5160/cga/256kb/array/)
and [EGA Displays](/devices/pc/machine/5160/ega/640kb/array/).

C1Pjs
---
Below is the [OSI Challenger C1P](/docs/c1pjs/), another simulation in the JavaScript Machines project.
It simulates Ohio Scientific's 6502-based microcomputer, released in 1978.  More details about this simulation
and the original machine are available in the [C1Pjs Documentation](/docs/c1pjs/).
