PCjs Documentation Demos
---

This folder provides all the self-contained [PCjs](/docs/about/pcjs/) demos described in the [Documentation](/docs/pcjs/).

To use them, download [samples.zip](samples.zip), unzip it into a folder on your desktop computer or web server,
and experiment with them in your web browser.  Since all these samples are self-contained, they should work with either
the "file:" or "http:" protocol.

+ Check out the sample HTML and XML files:
	- [sample1.html](sample1.html) and [sample1.xml](sample1.xml)
	- [sample2.html](sample2.html) and [sample2.xml](sample2.xml)
	- [sample3a.html](sample3a.html) and [sample3a.xml](sample3a.xml)
	- [sample3b.html](sample3b.html) and [sample3b.xml](sample3b.xml)
+ Feel free to copy/paste additional components from other machine XML files on [pcjs.org](http://www.pcjs.org/).
+ Remember to display the appropriate attribution on anything you share publicly; e.g.:

+ Stay in sync with the [PCjs repository](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs), to keep your copy of PCjs up-to-date.

Have fun!
