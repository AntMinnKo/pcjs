## About JavaScript Machines

The JavaScript Machines Project is a collection of computer simulations written in JavaScript.  It has been
released on [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the [PCjs Project](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs), a copy of which
is hosted here at [{{ site.pcjs.domain }}]({{ site.url }}/) (formerly [jsmachines.net](http://jsmachines.net/)). 

The goals of the project are to create fast, full-featured simulations of classic computer
hardware, help people understand how these early machines worked, make it easy to experiment with different machine
configurations, and provide a platform for running and analyzing old computer software.

The simulations are written entirely in JavaScript and run well in a variety of web browsers, on both
desktop and mobile devices.  Machines are created with simple XML files that define a set of machine components,
along with the features that each component should enable.  More details about machine definitions and component
capabilities can be found in the [Documentation](/docs/).

### Emulating the Challenger 1P

The first JavaScript Machines simulation was [C1Pjs](/docs/c1pjs/), a simulation of the
Challenger 1P, which was a 6502-based microcomputer introduced by Ohio Scientific in 1978.

C1Pjs v1.0 was released in July 2012, originally on ecpsim.org and cpusim.org, and then
[jsmachines.net](http://jsmachines.net/), which has since become [{{ site.pcjs.domain }}]({{ site.url }}/).
More information about the first release of C1Pjs was also [posted](http://osiweb.org/osiforum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=103)
on the [OSI Discussion Forum](http://osiweb.org/osiforum/index.php) at [osiweb.org](http://osiweb.org/).

### Emulating the IBM PC

The next JavaScript Machines simulation was [PCjs](/docs/about/pcjs/), which simulates the original IBM PC, IBM PC XT,
and IBM PC AT.

[PCjs](/docs/about/pcjs/) emulates the Intel 8088, 80186, 80286 and 80386 CPUs, as well as IBM Monochrome Display
Adapter (MDA), Color Graphics Adapter (CGA), Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), and Video Graphics Array (VGA) video
cards, along with assorted motherboard and expansion bus components.  It also includes an optional
[Debugger](/docs/pcjs/debugger/) and a user-configurable [Control Panel](/docs/pcjs/panel/).

PCjs v1.0 was released on [jsmachines.net](http://jsmachines.net/) in late 2012, and the JavaScript Machines Project,
with its second full-featured machine emulation, was launched.

Read [About PCjs](/docs/about/pcjs/) to learn more about its history, features, and upcoming improvements.

### Migrating to Node: The PCjs Project

The JavaScript Machines Project was migrated to a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) web server in 2014, and became the
PCjs Project.

The goals included:

- Using JavaScript exclusively, for both client and server development
- Leveraging the Node.js web server to provide more sophisticated I/O capabilities
- Improving overall website design, including structure, appearance and responsiveness

The PCjs web server includes a number of custom Node modules that provide many of the same server-side features
found on [jsmachines.net](http://jsmachines.net/), including new ROM and disk image conversion APIs, and a
Markdown module that supports a subset of the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
including extensions to the link syntax that make it easy to embed C1Pjs and PCjs machine files in Markdown documents.
