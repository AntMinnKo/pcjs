PCjs User API
===

The PCjs User API is not supported by the current PCjs web server.
When **pcjs.org** switched from a Node.js web server running on
[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) to
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the original server-side API had to be abandoned.

Support for PCjs user accounts, including remote disk storage, is still partially supported by the
Node.js server implementation, so if you really want to try it, you'll have to check out the
[Developer Notes](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs#user-content-developer-notes) section of the
[PCjs Project](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs) for instructions on running your own local copy of Node.js and the
PCjs web server.
