PCjs Reporting API
===

The PCjs Reporting API is not supported by the current PCjs web server.  When **pcjs.org** switched from a Node.js
web server running on Amazon Web Services to GitHub Pages, the server-side API had to be abandoned.

However, if you're encountering a serious problem with any of the machines on **pcjs.org**, feel free to
[send us a note](mailto:Jeff@pcjs.org) about the problem, along with a link to the machine.  Thanks.
