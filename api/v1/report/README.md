PCjs Reporting API
===

The PCjs Reporting API is not supported by the current PCjs web server.
When **pcjs.org** switched from a Node.js web server running on
[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) to
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the original server-side API had to be abandoned.

However, if you're encountering a serious problem with any of the machines on **pcjs.org**, feel free to
[send a note](mailto:Jeff@pcjs.org) about the problem, along with a link to the machine.  However, there is
no PCjs Customer Service Department, so we may or may not be able to help.
