This where all the server-side PHP code used to reside.  I've since deleted all the PHP code from the project,
because I've more-or-less finished porting it all to server-side JavaScript, in assorted modules located in
[my_modules](/my_modules/).

All that remains here is the version of Google's Closure Compiler (and its associated [README](README)) that I use
to build the client-side JavaScript files -- not because I have any attachment to this particular version, but because
updating requires a lot of testing, and I don't really have a regression test suite yet.
