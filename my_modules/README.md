Private Node Modules
===

**my_modules** contains all the *private* **PCjs** Node modules.  It is the counterpart to
**node_modules**, where all the *public* Node modules are installed.  Only private Node modules are checked
into GitHub; if any of these are later published on [npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org), then they will
be moved to **node_modules** and removed from this folder.
