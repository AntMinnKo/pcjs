 * function to the panel's output control ASAP, and again when the Computer component
 * is verifying that all components are ready and invoking their setPower() functions.
 *
 * Our setPower() method gives us a second opportunity to notify any components that
 * that might care (eg, CPU, Keyboard, and Debugger) that we have some controls they
