/**
 * loadXML(sFile, idMachine, sStateFile, fResolve)
 * 
 * This is the preferred way to load all XML and XSL files. It uses loadResource()
 * to load them as strings, which parseXML() can massage before parsing/transforming them.
 *
 * For example, since I've been unable to get the XSLT document() function to work inside any
 * XSL document loaded by JavaScript's XSLT processor, that has prevented me from dynamically
 * loading any XML machine file that uses the "ref" attribute to refer to and incorporate
 * another XML document.
 * 
 * To solve that, I've added an fResolve parameter that tells parseXML() to fetch any
 * referenced documents ITSELF and insert them into the XML string prior to parsing, instead
 * of relying on the XSLT template to pull them in.  That fetching is handled by resolveRefs(),
 * which iterates over the XML until all "refs" have been resolved (including any nested
 * references).
 *
 * Also, XSL files with a <!DOCTYPE [...]> cause MSIE's Microsoft.XMLDOM.loadXML() function
 * to choke, so I strip that out prior to parsing as well.
 *
 * TODO: Figure out why the XSLT document() function works great when the web browser loads an
 * XML file (and the associated XSL file) itself, but does not work when loading documents via
 * JavaScript XSLT support. Is it broken, is it a security issue, or am I just calling it wrong?
 *
 * @param {string} sXMLFile
 * @param {string} [idMachine]
 * @param {string} [sStateFile]
 * @param {boolean} [fResolve] is true to resolve any "ref" attributes
 * @return {Array} where [0] contains the unparsed XML string data, and [1] contains a parsed XML object
