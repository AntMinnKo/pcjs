 * CPU(parmsCPU, nCyclesDefault)
 *
 * The CPU class supports the following (parmsCPU) properties:
 *
 *      cycles: the machine's base cycles per second; the X86CPU constructor will
 *      provide us with a default (based on the CPU model) to use as a fallback
 *      
 *      multiplier: base cycle multiplier; default is 1
 *      
 *      autoStart: true to automatically start, false to not, or null (default)
 *      to make the autoStart decision based on whether or not a Debugger is
 *      installed (if there's no Debugger AND no "Run" button, then auto-start,
 *      otherwise don't)
 *
 *      csStart: the number of cycles that runCPU() must wait before generating
 *      checksum records; -1 if disabled. checksum records are a diagnostic aid
 *      used to help compare one CPU run to another.
 *
 *      csInterval: the number of cycles that runCPU() must execute before
 *      generating a checksum record; -1 if disabled.
 *
 *      csStop: the number of cycles to stop generating checksum records.
 *
 * This component is primarily responsible for interfacing the CPU with the outside
 * world (eg, Panel and Debugger components), and managing overall CPU operation.
 *
 * It is extended by the X86CPU component, where all the x86-specific logic resides.
