     * there's no attempt to provide any coordination among those mechanisms, except at the lowest
     * level, where scan code generation takes place.  addScanCode() insures that a key (scan code)
     * that's already in the "make" state will not trigger another "make" (unless a "repeat" has
     * been explicitly requested), and it insures that a key (scan code) already in the "break"
     * state will not trigger another "break".
     *
     * TODO: While it might seem sensible to save/restore this state data, I would argue that the
     * best thing to do on a save() is force a "break" of every key still active and NOT save this
     * data.  This relieves restore() from doing any extra work; it can simply assume -- as it has
     * always assumed -- that the keyboard is free of any active "makes".  That does mean saving
     * and restoring abScanBuffer, however, since the machine may not have been able to act upon
     * any of those forced "breaks" yet.
     *
     * TODO: addScanCode() should also provide a "fail-safe" mechanism that attempts to ensure that
     * a key cannot get stuck in the "make" state for more than a few seconds if the user did something
     * odd (eg, switched away from the current page or the entire browser mid-keystroke). For some browser
     * and key combinations (eg, Ctrl-Tab), this may be essential, to avoid stuck shift/modifier keys.

/*
 * This array is used by keyEventSimulate() to lookup a given charCode and convert it to a scan code
 * (lower byte) plus any required shift key states (upper bytes).
 *
 * Using charCodes (from keyPress events) proved to be more robust than using keyCodes (from keyDown and
 * keyUp events), in part because of differences in the way browsers generate the keyDown and keyUp events.
 * For example, Safari on iOS devices will not generate up/down events for shift keys, and for other keys,
 * the up/down events are usually generated after the actual press is complete, and in rapid succession,
 * which doesn't always give the simulation enough time to detect the key.
 * 
 * The other problem (which is more of a problem with keyboards like the C1P than any IBM keyboards) is
 * that the shift/modifier state for a character on the "source" keyboard may not match the shift/modifier
 * state for the same character on the "target" keyboard.  And since this code is inherited from C1Pjs,
 * we've inherited the same solution: keyEventSimulate() has the ability to "undo" any states in bitsShift
 * that conflict with the state(s) required for the character in question.
 *
 * There are still a few times that I call keyEventSimulate() from keyEvent(), and for those occasions,
 * I create a pseudo-charCode value by adding CHARCODE.PSEUDO (0xE0) to the keyCode value, to avoid any
 * confusion with real charCodes:
 *
 *      CHARCODE_LSHIFT     (originally 0x10, which also looks like CTRL-P, so converted to 0xF0)
 *      CHARCODE_CTRL       (originally 0x11, which also looks like CTRL-Q, so converted to 0xF1)
 *      CHARCODE_ALT        (originally 0x12, which also looks like CTRL-R, so converted to 0xF2)
 *      CHARCODE_CAPSLOCK   (originally 0x14, which also looks like CTRL-T, so converted to 0xF4)
 *
 * Again, as things currently stand, iOS devices should never generate the above charCodes, so any emulated
 * software that relies detecting on shift-key state changes will not work on those devices.
