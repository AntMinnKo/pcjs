     * and restoring abScanBuffer, however, since the machine may not have been able to act upon
     * any of those forced "breaks" yet.
     *
     * TODO: addScanCode() should also provide a "fail-safe" mechanism that attempts to ensure that
     * a key cannot get stuck in the "make" state for more than a few seconds if the user did something
     * odd (eg, switched away from the current page or the entire browser mid-keystroke). For some browser
     * and key combinations (eg, Ctrl-Tab), this may be essential, to avoid stuck shift/modifier keys.

/**
 * Define "soft keyboard" identifiers for all possible keys, based on their primary (unshifted) character
 * or function.  This also serves as a definition of all supported scan codes.
 *
 * One exception to the above rule is 'prtsc': on the original IBM 83-key and 84-key keyboards, its primary
 * (unshifted) character was '*', but on 101-key keyboards, it became a separate key ('prtsc', now labeled
 * 'Print Screen'), as did the num-pad '*' ('num-mul'), so 'prtsc' seems worthy of an exception to the rule.
 *
 * On 83-key and 84-key keyboards, 'ctrl'+'num-lock' triggered a "pause" operation and 'ctrl'+'scroll-lock'
 * triggered a "break" operation (I'm using double-quotes to describe the operations and single-quotes to
 * describe the keys).
 *
 * On 101-key keyboards, IBM decided to move both those special operations to a new 'pause' key, alongside
 * the dedicated 'prtsc' ('Print Screen') key.  Those keys behaved as follows:
 *
 *      When 'pause' is pressed alone, it generates 0xe1 0x1d 0x45 0xe1 0x9d 0xc5 on make (nothing on break),
 *      which essentially simulates the make-and-break of the 'ctrl' and 'num-lock' keys (ignoring the 0xe1),
 *      triggering a "pause" operation.
 *
 *      When 'pause' is pressed with 'ctrl', it generates 0xe0 0x46 0xe0 0xc6 on make (nothing on break) and
 *      does not repeat, which essentially simulates the make-and-break of 'scroll-lock', which, in conjunction
 *      with the separate make-and-break of 'ctrl', triggers a "break" operation.
 *
 *      When 'prtsc' is pressed alone, it generates 0xe0 0x2a 0xe0 0x37, simulating the make of both 'shift'
 *      and 'prtsc'; when pressed with 'shift' or 'ctrl', it generates only 0xe0 0x37; and when pressed with
 *      'alt', it generates only 0x54 (to simulate 'sysreq').
 *
 * All key identifiers must be quotable using single-quotes, because that's how components.xsl will encode them
 * in the "data-value" attribute of the corresponding HTML control.  Which, in turn, is why the single-quote
 * key is defined as 'quote' rather than "'".  Similarly, if there was unshifted "double-quote" key, it could
 * not be called '"', because XML files must quote all their bindings using double-quotes.
 *
 * In the (informal) numbering of keys below, two keys are deliberately numbered 84, reflecting the fact that
 * the 'sysreq' key was added to the 84-key keyboard but then dropped from the 101-key keyboard.
 *
 * @enum {number}

/**
 * This array is used by keyEventSimulate() to lookup a given keyCode and convert it to a scan code
 * (lower byte) plus any required shift key states (upper bytes).
 *
 * Using keyCodes from keyPress events proved to be more robust than using keyCodes from keyDown and
 * keyUp events, in part because of differences in the way browsers generate the keyDown and keyUp events.
 * For example, Safari on iOS devices will not generate up/down events for shift keys, and for other keys,
 * the up/down events are usually generated after the actual press is complete, and in rapid succession,
 * which doesn't always give the simulation enough time to detect the key.
 *
 * The other problem (which is more of a problem with keyboards like the C1P than any IBM keyboards) is
 * that the shift/modifier state for a character on the "source" keyboard may not match the shift/modifier
 * state for the same character on the "target" keyboard.  And since this code is inherited from C1Pjs,
 * we've inherited the same solution: keyEventSimulate() has the ability to "undo" any states in bitsShift
 * that conflict with the state(s) required for the character in question.
