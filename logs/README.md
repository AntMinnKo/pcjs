Logs
---
This is where Node web server activity is logged, where bug reports are saved, and where per-user data is stored.

Per-user data is still in the experimental phase, and is enabled ONLY for users that have requested and received
their own per-user directory.

The website does not use cookies or any other form of user tracking, and Express server logs are maintained only to
help identify problems with the web server.
