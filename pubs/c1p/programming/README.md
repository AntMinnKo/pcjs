### 6502 ASSEMBLER/DISASSEMBLER

This "source code listing" from June 19, 1980 represents the first piece of software I sold, right around the
time I graduated from high school.  I had had my Ohio Scientific Challenger 1P for maybe a year when I decided
to write something that would make it easier to write "machine language" programs than the incredibly tedious
HEX monitor that was built into the C1P.  And so my **6502 ASSEMBLER/DISASSEMBLER** was born, with full-screen
editor, assembler, and disassembler.

One of the conditions of the sale, however, was that I provide a "source code" listing.  I don't think the buyer
understood that I had essentially written the program in machine language -- because that's how I had to enter it
into the machine.  Maybe some lucky C1P users had disk drives and editors and assemblers, but I had none of those
of things.  I had never even used tools like that before, which is why the **6502 ASSEMBLER/DISASSEMBLER** is a
bit of an odd duck.  I'll post some screenshots and a demo eventually, and you'll see what I mean.

Anyway, to satisfy the buyer, I sat down at my old manual typewriter and banged out my version of a "source
code" listing.  I produced it mostly by using using the program to disassemble itself, combined with information
from hand-written notes (which I may still have somewhere).  Here it is, many decades later, for your amusement.
