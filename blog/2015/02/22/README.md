Compaq DeskPro 386
---
I finally dumped the [Compaq DeskPro 386-16 ROMs](/devices/pc/bios/compaq/deskpro386/) from the motherboard I bought
on ebay last year, so I'm ready to begin adding 80386 support to PCjs.

I'd also like to locate a copy of the "Compaq DeskPro 386 Technical Reference Guide, Volumes 1 and 2".  It's not hard
to find Compaq Maintenance and Service guides online, but their Technical Reference guides are much rarer, perhaps because
they were expensive ($149) and not many were sold.  Anyway, I'm hoping to either borrow or buy a copy, and then scan and
post it.

A Compaq DeskPro 386 test configuration is displayed below.  It's located at:

> [/devices/pc/machine/compaq/deskpro386/ega/2048Kb/](/devices/pc/machine/compaq/deskpro386/ega/2048Kb/)
	
The configuration doesn't run, and the debugger can't disassemble 80386-specific code yet, but this is what I will be
using to test and debug my changes over the next few months.
