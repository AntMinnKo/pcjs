More Under-The-Hood Changes
---
v1.13.7 of PCjs contains a few minor improvements, mostly in terms of rendering video modes a little more
efficiently.  The rest of the changes to the website involved beefing up support for both "software manifests"
and "document manifests."

To that end, there's a new [/pubs/]() directory for old documents, and [/disks/pc/]() contains more disk images,
with more on the way.  I have a TON of old diskette images, and it has taken more time to organize them and create
manifests than I would like.  I have managed to streamline the process somewhat, however, as discussed in
[/disks/pc/personal/]().
