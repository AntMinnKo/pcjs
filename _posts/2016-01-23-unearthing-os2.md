Before OS/2 was named **OS/2** by IBM on April 2, 1987 (as part of IBM's "Divide By Two And Conquer" initiative),
OS/2 was known variously as **CP-DOS**, **MT-DOS**, **DOS5**, or **ADOS**.  Or, when referring to 80286-only and
80386-only versions: **286DOS** and **386DOS**.

And then there were all the early codes-names, like **SIZZLE**, **PIGSKIN**, and **FOOTBALL**, which were little-known
projects to help improve and/or shape the direction that OS/2 was headed.

To shed some light on those efforts, I recently added a small collection of early (mostly pre-1.0) OS/2 boot disks
that provide a glimpse of what early OS/2 builds looked like.

More details are available in [OS/2 Prototype Disks](/disks/pc/os2/misc/).
