I finally obtained a [ROM Dump](/devices/pc/rom/compaq/bios/portable/) from COMPAQ's first machine,
the [COMPAQ Portable](#compaq-portable).

At the same time, I thought it would be a good idea to create my own roughly chronological list of COMPAQ machines from
the 1980s, since they are all machines I would like to see PCjs eventually support:

 + [COMPAQ Portable](#compaq-portable)
 + [COMPAQ [Portable] Plus](#compaq-portable-plus-aka-compaq-plus)
 + [COMPAQ DeskPro](#compaq-deskpro)
 + [COMPAQ DeskPro 286](#compaq-deskpro-286)
 + [COMPAQ Portable 286](#compaq-portable-286)
 + [COMPAQ Portable II](#compaq-portable-ii)
 + [COMPAQ DeskPro 386](#compaq-deskpro-386)
 + [COMPAQ Portable III](#compaq-portable-iii)
 + [COMPAQ Portable 386](#compaq-portable-386)
 + [COMPAQ 386/20e](#compaq-38620e)
 + [COMPAQ SLT Series](#compaq-slt-series)
	 + COMPAQ SLT/286
 + [COMPAQ LTE Series](#compaq-lte-series)
	 + COMPAQ LTE 286
	 + COMPAQ LTE 386

It's hard to stop at this point, because COMPAQ did produce other 80386-based systems, like those in the "LTE Lite"
series.  But I think I need to stick my original plan and draw a line at the end of the 1980s.

Below is a random assortment of information I've gathered about some of the above models, with gaping holes for others.
Currently, the *most* gaping is the [COMPAQ DeskPro 386](#compaq-deskpro-386), because that's the one COMPAQ machine
that PCjs *already* supports.  I just need more time to organize and fill in the details.
