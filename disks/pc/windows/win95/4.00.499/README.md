Microsoft Windows 95 (Build 499)
---

This version of Windows 95 was one of the last (if not THE last) test versions produced before the
[final retail version](/disks/pc/windows/win95/4.00.950/)
was released to manufacturing on July 14, 2015 and later went on sale at midnight on August 24, 1995.

The PCjs Project has the only known version of this 13-disk test release.
