Microsoft Windows 95 (Build 499)
---

This version of Windows 95 was one of the last (if not *the* last) test versions produced before the
[final retail version](/disks/pc/windows/win95/4.00.950/)
was released to manufacturing on July 14, 1995 and went on sale at midnight on August 24, 1995.

The PCjs Project has the only known online copy of this 13-disk test release.
