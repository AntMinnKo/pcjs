### OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v7.68.17)

The [OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v7.68.17)](/disks/pc/os2/misc/football/debugger/) contains a prototype version of OS/2
from early 1987 that was designed to test new features of the Intel 80386 processor (eg, paging and V86-mode).
This prototype was forked from pre-1.0 OS/2 sources, and the only hardware it supported was the Compaq DeskPro 386-16.
It was never released outside of Microsoft and IBM.
