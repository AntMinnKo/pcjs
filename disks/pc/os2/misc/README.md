OS/2 Prototype Disks
---

Below are some interesting pre-1.0 (or 1.0-based) OS/2 revisions we have unearthed.  They provide an early glimpse
of OS/2 when it was still a work-in-progress.  Not all of the disks run properly in PCjs yet, but we're working on it.

### CP-DOS

#### OS/2 CP-DOS Boot Disk (v7.68)

The [OS/2 CP-DOS Boot Disk (v7.68)](/disks/pc/os2/misc/cpdos/86295/) contained a pre-1.0 version of OS/2 built on
October 22, 1986.

### SIZZLE

#### OS/2 SIZZLE Boot Disk (v7.68.18)

The [OS/2 SIZZLE Boot Disk (v7.68.18)](/disks/pc/os2/misc/cpdos/87007/) contained a pre-1.0 version of OS/2
built on January 7, 1987, which was based on an interim source code fork known as "SIZZLE", the code-name for a
collection of changes intended to improve overall OS/2 performance.

#### OS/2 SIZZLE Boot Disk (v7.68.18 DEBUG)

The [OS/2 SIZZLE Boot Disk (v7.68.18 DEBUG)](/disks/pc/os2/misc/cpdos/87007/debug/) was largely identical to the
previous disk, with the exception of a *DEBUG* kernel (with built-in debugger) and a different assortment of tools.

### FOOTBALL

#### OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v7.68.17)

The [OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v7.68.17)](/disks/pc/os2/misc/football/87058/) contained a prototype version of OS/2
from February 1987 that was designed to test two important new features of the Intel 80386 processor: paging and V86-mode.
This prototype was forked from pre-1.0 OS/2 sources, and the only hardware it supported was the COMPAQ DeskPro 386-16.

#### OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v4.41.00)

The [OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v4.41.00)](/disks/pc/os2/misc/football/87357/) contained an updated FOOTBALL prototype.
It was built in December 1987, using final OS/2 1.0 sources merged with assorted FOOTBALL changes, and although 
it was originally assigned version number 1.3, this version of OS/2 would ultimately become 2.0.

### Miscellaneous

#### OS/2 1.0 Debugger Boot Disk

The [OS/2 1.0 Debugger Boot Disk](/disks/pc/os2/misc/1.0/88286/) contained a version of OS/2 1.0 built on
October 12, 1988, which included the built-in kernel debugger used by Microsoft and IBM for internal development,
along with a rudimentary program selector.  For more details, see the [OS/2 1.0](/blog/2014/12/04/) blog post.
