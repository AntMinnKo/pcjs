### OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v7.68.17)

The [OS/2 FOOTBALL Boot Disk (v7.68.17)](/disks/pc/os2/misc/football/debugger/) contains a prototype version of OS/2
from early 1987 that added preliminary support for the Intel 80386 processor, including limited support for 32-bit code
and the ability to run multiple DOS applications in V86-mode.  It was forked from pre-OS/2 1.0 sources, and the only
machine it supported was the Compaq DeskPro 386-16.
