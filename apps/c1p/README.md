Challenger 1P Serial Program Sets
---

The C1P serial port has no configurable hardware features.  However, there is a "demo" property that can
be set, causing the machine to load some built-in demonstration code via the serial port when it starts up.

The purpose of these configuration files is to create UI controls that allow you to choose from a set of programs
(eg, BASIC programs, 6502 machine code files) and send them to the C1P through the serial port.
