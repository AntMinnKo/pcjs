Challenger 1P Applications
---

See [GitHub](https://github.com/jeffpar/pcjs/tree/master/apps/c1p) for program listings and configuration files.

The C1P serial port has no configurable hardware features.  However, there is a "demo" property that can
be set, causing the machine to load some built-in demonstration code via the serial port when it starts up.

The purpose of the configuration files is to create UI controls that allow you to choose from a set of programs
(eg, BASIC programs, 6502 machine code files) and send them to the C1P through the serial port.
