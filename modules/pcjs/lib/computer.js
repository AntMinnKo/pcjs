/*
 * BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
 *
 * To build PCjs (pc.js), run Google's Closure Compiler, replacing "*.js" with
 * the input file sequence defined by the "pcJSFiles" property in package.json:
 *
 *      java -jar compiler.jar
 *          --compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS
 *          --define='DEBUG=false'
 *          --warning_level=VERBOSE
 *          --js *.js
 *          --js_output_file pc.js
 *
 * Google's Closure Compiler (compiler.jar) is documented at
 * https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/ and is available
 * for download here:
 *
 *      http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip
 *
 * The PCjs JavaScript files do have some initialization-order dependencies.
 * If you load the files individually, it's recommended that you load them in
 * the same order that they're compiled.
 *
 * Generally speaking, component.js should be first, computer.js should be
 * last (of the files based on component.js), and panel.js should be listed
 * early so that the Control Panel is ready as soon as possible.
 *
 * Another recent ordering requirement is that rom.js must be loaded before
 * ram.js; this was true before, but now it's required, because I'm starting
 * to add ROM BIOS Data Area definitions to rom.js, and since the data area
 * is in RAM, ram.js may want access to some of those definitions.

 * @constructor

 * @param {Object} parmsComputer
 * @param {Object} [parmsMachine]
 * @param {boolean} [fSuspended]
 *
 * The Computer component has no required (parmsComputer) properties, but does
 * support the following:
 *
 *      busWidth: number of memory address lines (address bits) on the computer's "bus";
 *      20 is the minimum (and the default), which implies 8086/8088 real-mode addressing,
 *      while 24 is required for 80286 protected-mode addressing.  This value is passed
 *      directly through to the Bus component; see that component for more details.
 *
 *      resume: one of the Computer.RESUME constants, which are as follows:
 *          '0' if resume disabled (default)
 *          '1' if enabled without prompting
 *          '2' if enabled with prompting
 *          '3' if enabled with prompting and auto-delete
 *          or a string containing the path of a predefined JSON-encoded state
 *
 *      state: the path to JSON-encoded state file (see details regarding 'state' below)
 *
 * If a predefined state is supplied AND it's successfully loaded, then resume behavior
 * defaults to '1' (ie, resume enabled without prompting).
 *
 * This component insures that all components are ready before "powering" them.
 *
 * Different components become ready at different times, and initialization order (ie,
 * the order the scripts are combined on the page) only partially determines readiness.
 * This is because components like ROM and Video must finish loading their resource files
 * before they are ready.  Other components become ready after we call their initBus()
 * function, because they have a Bus or CPU dependency, such as access to memory management
 * functions.  And other components, like CPU and Panel, are ready as soon as their
 * constructor finishes.
 *
 * Once a component has indicated it's ready, we call its powerUp() notification
 * function (if it has one--it's optional).  We call the CPU's powerUp() function last,
 * so that the CPU is assured that all other components are ready and "powered".

 *
 * There's one scenario that powerOff() isn't currently able to deal with very effectively: what to do when
 * the user switches away while it's still being restored, causing Disk loadResource() calls to fail.  The
 * Disk component calls notify() when that happens -- see Disk.mount() -- but the FDC and HDC controllers don't
 * notify *us* of those problems, so Computer assumes that the restore was completely successful, when in fact
 * it was only partially successful.
 *
 * Then we immediately arrive here to perform a save, following that incomplete restore.  It would be wrong to
 * deal with that incomplete restore by setting fRestoreError, because we don't want to trigger a powerReport()
 * and the deletion of the previous state, because the state itself was presumably OK.  Unfortunately, the new
 * state we now save will no longer include manually mounted disk images whose remounts were interrupted, so future
 * restores won't remount them either.
 *
 * We could perhaps solve this by having the Disk component notify us in those situations, set a new flag
 * (fRestoreIncomplete?), and set fSave to false if that's ever set.  Be careful though: when fSave is false,
 * that means MORE than not saving; it also means deleting any previous state, which is NOT what you'd want to
 * do in a "fRestoreIncomplete" situation.  Also, we have to worry about Disk operations that fail for other reasons,
 * making sure those failures don't interfere with the save process in the same way.
 *
 * As it stands, the worst that happens is any manually mounted disk images might have to be manually remounted,
 * which doesn't seem like a huge problem.

 * using our powerOff() function, before the page goes away.
 *
 * It's worth noting that "onbeforeunload" offers one nice feature when used instead of "onload": the entire
 * page (and therefore this entire application) is retained in its current state by the browser (well, some
 * browsers), so that if you go to a new URL, either by entering a new URL in the same window/tab, or by pressing
 * the FORWARD button, and then you press the BACK button, the page is immediately restored to its previous state.
 *
 * In fact, that's how some browsers operate whether you have an "onbeforeunload" handler or not; in other words,
 * an "onbeforeunload" handler doesn't change the page retention behavior of the browser.  By contrast, the mere
 * presence of an "onunload" handler generally causes a browser to throw the page away once the handler returns.
 *
 * However, in order to safely use "onbeforeunload", we must add yet another handler ("onpageshow") to repower
 * everything, without either resetting or restoring.  Hence, the Computer.show() function, which calls powerOn()
 * with a special resume value (RESUME_REPOWER) if the computer is already marked as "ready", meaning the browser
 * didn't change anything.  This "repower" process should be very quick, essentially just marking all components as
 * powered again (so that, for example, the Video component will start drawing again) and firing the CPU up again.
 *
 * Reportedly, some browsers (eg, Opera) don't support "onbeforeunload", in which case Component will have to use
 * "unload" instead.  But even when the page must be rebuilt from scratch, the combination of browser cache and
 * localStorage means the simulation should be restored and become operational almost immediately.
