 * nearly all of debugger.js will be conditionally removed by the compiler, reducing it to little more than a
 * "type skeleton", which also solves some type-related warnings we would otherwise have if we tried to remove
 * debugger.js from the compilation process altogether.
 *
 * However, when we're in "development mode" and running uncompiled code in debugger-less configurations,
 * I would like to skip loading debugger.js altogether.  When doing that, we must ALSO arrange for an additional file
 * (nodebugger.js) to be loaded immediately after this file, which *explicitly* overrides DEBUGGER with *false*.

 * to choose any block size for physical memory allocations that made sense for the bus width (eg, 4Kb blocks for a
 * 20-bit bus, or 16Kb blocks for 24-bit bus).
 *
 * However, for the 80386 processor, it makes more sense to choose a block size that matches the page size (ie, 4Kb),
 * because then we have the option of altering the address-to-memory mapping for any block to match whatever page table
 * mapping is in effect for that address, if any, without requiring another layer of address translation.
