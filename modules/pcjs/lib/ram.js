/**
 * CompaqController(ram)
 *
 * DeskPro 386 machines came with a minimum of 1Mb of RAM, which could be configured (via jumpers)
 * for 256Kb, 512Kb or 640Kb of conventional memory, starting at address 0x00000000, with the
 * remainder (768Kb, 512Kb, or 384Kb) accessible only at addresses just below 0x01000000.  This
 * second chunk of RAM must have an ID of "ramCPQ".
 *
 * The typical configuration was 640Kb of conventional memory, leaving 384Kb accessible at 0x00FA0000.
 * Presumably, the other configurations (256Kb and 512Kb) would leave 768Kb and 512Kb accessible at
 * 0x00F40000 and 0x00F80000, respectively.
 *
 * The DeskPro 386 also contained two memory-mapped registers at 0x80C00000.  The first is a write-only
 * mapping register that provides the ability to map the 128Kb at 0x00FE0000 to 0x000E0000, replacing
 * any ROMs in the range 0x000E0000-0x000FFFFF, and optionally write-protecting that 128Kb.  The second
 * register is a read-only diagnostics register that indicates jumper configuration and parity errors.
 *
 * To emulate the memory-mapped registers at 0x80C00000, the RAM component allocates a block at that
 * address using this custom controller once it sees an allocation for "ramCPQ".
 *
 * Later, when the addressibility of "ramCPQ" memory is altered, we record the blocks in all the
 * memory slots spanning 0x000E0000-0x000FFFFF, and then update those slots with the blocks from
 * 0x00FE0000-0x00FFFFFF.  Note that only the top 128Kb of "ramCPQ" addressibility is affected; the
 * rest of that memory, ranging anywhere from 256Kb to 640Kb, remains addressible at its original
 * location.  Compaq's CEMM and VDISK utilities were generally the only software able to access that
 * remaining memory.
