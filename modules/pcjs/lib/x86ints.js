 * For protected-mode, this function must attempt to load the new code segment first, because if the new segment
 * requires a change in privilege level, the return address must be pushed on the NEW stack, not the current stack.
 *
 * Also, we rely on a new function, pushData(), instead of pushWord(), to accommodate the outgoing segment size,
 * which may differ from the incoming segment.  For example, when a 32-bit code segment performs a 16:32 call to a
 * 16-bit code segment, we must push 32-bit segment and offset values.
 *
 * TODO: Since setCSIP() already informs the segCS load() function when it's making a call, the load() function
 * could automatically push the old CS and IP values *before* segCS is updated -- which would be a better time to do
 * those pushes AND eliminate the need for pushData().  Unfortunately, load() is also used by loadIDT(), and loadIDT()
 * has different requirements (eg, pushing flags first), so it's not a trivial change.
