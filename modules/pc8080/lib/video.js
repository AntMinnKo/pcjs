         * HACK: Android-based browsers, like the Silk (Amazon) browser and Chrome for Android, don't honor the
         * "contenteditable" attribute; that is, when the canvas receives focus, they don't activate the on-screen
         * keyboard.  So my fallback is to create a transparent textarea on top of the canvas.
         *
         * The parent DIV must have a style of "position:relative" (alternatively, a class of "pcjs-container"),
         * so that we can position the textarea using absolute coordinates.  Also, we don't want the textarea to be
         * visible, but we must use "opacity:0" instead of "visibility:hidden", because the latter seems to prevent
         * the element from receiving events.  These styling requirements are taken care of in components.css
         * (see references to the "pcjs-video-object" class).
         *
         * UPDATE: Unfortunately, Android keyboards like to compose whole words before transmitting any of the
         * intervening characters; our textarea's keyDown/keyUp event handlers DO receive intervening key events,
         * but their keyCode property is ZERO.  Virtually the only usable key event we receive is the Enter key.
         * Android users will have to use machines that include their own on-screen "soft keyboard", or use an
         * external keyboard.
         *
         * The following attempt to use a password-enabled input field didn't work any better on Android.  You could
         * clearly see the overlaid semi-transparent input field, but none of the input characters were passed along,
         * with the exception of the "Go" (Enter) key.
         *
         *      var eInput = document.createElement("input");
         *      eInput.setAttribute("type", "password");
         *      eInput.setAttribute("style", "position:absolute; left:0; top:0; width:100%; height:100%; opacity:0.5");
