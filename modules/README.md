PCjs Node Modules
===

This folder contains all the **PCjs** JavaScript source code, organized into Node modules.  It is the counterpart to
**node_modules**, where all the *public* Node modules are installed.

Only private Node modules are checked into this project.  If any of these modules are later published on
[npmjs.org](http://npmjs.org), then they will be moved to **node_modules** and removed from this folder.
