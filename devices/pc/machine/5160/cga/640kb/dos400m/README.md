"Multitasking" MS-DOS 4.00
---

This simulation demonstrates the first unearthed copy of Microsoft's "multitasking" version of MS-DOS.  The
[original images](/disks/pc/dos/microsoft/4.0M/) were released on [jsmachines.net](http://jsmachines.net/)
in March, 2013, and have since been copied to other web sites.  This version of MS-DOS was never officially released
in North America.  More information is available at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-tasking_MS-DOS_4.0)
and [OS/2 Museum](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/?p=1769).

Note: The designation "4.0M" is not an official version number; it's an internal version number used only to
differentiate these disk images from those of the official MS-DOS 4.00, released in June, 1988. 

The PCjs machine configuration below boots MS-DOS 4.0M.  To access the MS-DOS "Session Manager" after it's booted,
tap the **Alt** key.
