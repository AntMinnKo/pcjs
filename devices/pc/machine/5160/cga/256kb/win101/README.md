[IBM PC](machine.xml "PCjs:ibm5160")

The above simulation is configured for a clock speed of 4.77Mhz, with 256Kb of RAM and a CGA display,
using the original IBM PC Model 5160 ROM BIOS and CGA font ROM.

This PC XT configuration also includes a 10Mb hard disk with Windows 1.01 pre-installed.
This particular configuration will NOT save any changes when your browser exits, since it has
been pre-configured to always start Windows 1.01 in the same state.

NOTE: The Windows 1.01 mouse pointer can be controlled with your mouse, but only when your mouse is
within the "CGA Display" window. This is a restriction imposed by your web browser, not PCjs.

For more control over this machine, try the [Control Panel](debugger/) configuration, featuring the
built-in PCjs Debugger, with save/restore enabled.
