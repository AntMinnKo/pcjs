Compaq DeskPro 386 ROMs
---
The oldest Compaq DeskPro 386 ROM I have is a Rev J.4 ROM from a "Version 2" motherboard designed
in 1987 and released in 1988.

Thanks to folks on the [Vintage Computer](http://www.vintage-computer.com/) forums, I also have a Rev N.1 ROM from 1989.

However, I'm still on the lookout for any "Version 1" motherboards from 1986, so that I can obtain dumps of Compaq's
ROMs for their earliest 80386-based systems.

[1988-01-28.json]() was created with the following [FileDump](/modules/filedump/) command:

	filedump --file=109592-001.hex --merge=109591-001.hex --output=1988-01-28.json

For a more human-readable dump, use this command:

	filedump --file=109592-001.hex --merge=109591-001.hex --comments

And for those who prefer a binary file, the FileDump API can be used to recreate binary data from JSON data:

> [http://www.pcjs.org/api/v1/dump?file=http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pc/bios/compaq/deskpro386/1988-01-28.json&format=rom](http://www.pcjs.org/api/v1/dump?file=http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pc/bios/compaq/deskpro386/1988-01-28.json&format=rom)

Similarly, [1989-04-14.json]() was generated by first creating [1989-04-14.rom](http://www.pcjs.org/api/v1/dump?file=http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pc/bios/compaq/deskpro386/1989-04-14.json&format=rom)
from the two 16Kb BIN files provided by [Al Kossow](http://www.vintage-computer.com/vcforum/member.php?2256-Al-Kossow):

	filedump --file=private/109592-005.U11.bin --merge=private/109591-005.U13.bin --output=private/1989-04-14.rom --format=rom
	filedump --file=private/1989-04-14.rom --output=1989-04-14.json

The *.hex* files for the 1988-01-28 DeskPro ROM were produced by running [eeprom_read](http://github.com/phooky/PROM/blob/master/tools/eeprom_read/eeprom_read.pde)
on a [chipKIT Uno32](http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,892,893&Prod=CHIPKIT-UNO32) Arduino-compatible
prototyping board, and capturing the serial port output on my MacBook Pro -- as outlined in
"[Stick a Straw in Its Brain and Suck: How to Read a ROM](http://www.nycresistor.com/2012/07/07/stick-a-straw-in-its-brain-and-suck-how-to-read-a-rom/)"
by [NYC Resistor](http://www.nycresistor.com/) contributor [phooky](http://www.nycresistor.com/author/phooky/).

The DeskPro 386 ROMs were P27128A-2 chips, so I wired my Uno32 based on this [27128A](/pubs/pc/datasheets/static/27128A.pdf)
datasheet -- the closest match I could find online.

![Compaq DeskPro 386 System ROM Version 2](/pubs/pc/reference/compaq/static/images/Compaq_DeskPro_386-16_System_ROM_V2_Breadboard-640.jpg "link:/pubs/pc/reference/compaq/static/images/Compaq_DeskPro_386-16_System_ROM_V2_Breadboard.jpg")

On my first dump attempt, every ROM address returned 0xFF.  After looking at the 27128A datasheet more closely, I noticed
the DEVICE OPERATION table indicated that, for a READ operation, /CE and /OE pins should be connected to INPUT LOW VOLTAGE,
while the /PGM should be connected to INPUT HIGH VOLTAGE.  So I wired pin 27 (/PGM) to +5V instead of GND, and the dump
worked perfectly.  The NYC Resistor article implied that every *active low* pin should be connected to GND, but apparently
there are exceptions to that general rule.

Producing BIOS Source Code
---
In the current directory, I ran NDISASM (the disassembler included with NASM):

	ndisasm -o0x8000 -se105h -se05ah -se6ffh -sf025h -sf8aah private/1988-01-28.rom > 1988-01-28.nasm

The `-o0x8000` argument is required to "org" the file at the proper starting address, but the `-s` arguments
are optional; they simply establish a few sync points within the ROM image that save a little cleanup effort, by
preventing disassembly in the middle of instructions.

Then I ran the PCjs [TextOut](/modules/textout/lib/) command, with the *--nasm* option, to prepare the code for reassembly:

	node ~/Sites/pcjs/modules/textout/bin/textout --file=1988-01-28.nasm --nasm > t.nasm
	mv t.nasm 1988-01-28.nasm

The result, [1988-01-28.nasm](1988-01-28.nasm), after a small amount of manual cleanup, can now be successfully reassembled:

	nasm -f bin 1988-01-28.nasm -l 1988-01-28.lst -o 1988-01-28.rom

However, it does NOT produce a binary identical to the original ROM, in part because of instruction ambiguities (ie,
instructions that can be assembled multiple ways). 

It's possible that the reassembled ROM may still work, but more research is required.

One interesting section of the Compaq DeskPro ROM is this string at offset 0xE002:
 
	db	'AUTHORS CAB93GLB93RWS93DJC93NPB(C)Copyright COMPAQ Computer Corporation 1982,83,84,85,86'

Anyone care to take a stab at what `CAB93GLB93RWS93DJC93NPB` means?  I've already confirmed that
[Google](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=CAB93GLB93RWS93DJC93NPB) doesn't know.
