IBM PC Control Panels
---

[Control Panels](/docs/pcx86/panel/) are XML files that define layouts for Debugger-related controls.

The following IBM PC control panel configuration files are currently available:

 - [default.xml](default.xml) (a simple layout for 8086/8088-based machines)
 - [wide.xml](wide.xml) (a wide version of default.xml)
 - [wide386.xml](wide386.xml) (a wide version of default.xml for 80386-based machines)

The visual controls described by these layouts are provided by the [Computer](/docs/pcx86/computer/),
[CPU](/docs/pcx86/cpu/), [Keyboard](/docs/pcx86/keyboard/), and [Debugger](/docs/pcx86/debugger/) components.
