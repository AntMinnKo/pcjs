Device Configurations
---

All PCjs machines are built from the following collections of devices:
 
* 6502-based Devices (e.g., [Challenger 1P](c1p/machine/))
* [8080-based Devices](pc8080/) (e.g., [Space Invaders](pc8080/machine/invaders/))
* [8086-based Devices](pcx86/) (e.g., [IBM PC, including 80286 and 80386-based compatibles](pcx86/machine/))

These devices are user-installable components that you would typically find in a real personal computer,
such as keyboards, disk controllers with one or more disk drives, video cards, etc.
