Device Configurations
---

All PCjs machines are built from the following collections of devices:
 
* [IBM PC Devices](pc/)
* [Challenger 1P Devices](c1p/)

These devices are user-installable components that you would typically find in a real personal computer,
such as keyboards, disk controllers with one or more disk drives, video cards, etc.
